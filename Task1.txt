Key Findings :-

1. Accident Hotspots & Black Spots
1.1. 12 major black spots identified by police (e.g., NH‚Äë19, Badkhal flyover, Bata Chowk, KGP Expressway).
1.2. These areas recorded approximately 157 deaths and 357 accidents (2020‚Äì2022).
1.3. A GIS-based study identified 11 more crash-prone locations along NH‚Äë44.

2. Road Condition Factors
2.1. Poor signage, lighting, and drainage were common issues.
2.2. Waterlogged underpasses led to fatal night accidents.
2.3. Expressways lacked enforcement‚Äîtwo-wheelers often entered high-speed lanes.

3. Weather Conditions
3.1. Monsoon-linked waterlogging contributed to deadly crashes.
3.2. While no localized weather-crash dataset exists, global data confirms higher accident risks in wet/low-visibility conditions.

4. Time of Day Trends
4.1. High fatality rates observed during:
4.1.1. 2 AM ‚Äì 4 AM (due to driver fatigue, low visibility).
4.1.2. 7 AM ‚Äì 9 AM (rush hour).

5. Behavioral Patterns
5.1. Common violations included: wrong-side driving, helmet non-use, speeding, and drunk driving.
5.2. Helmet-related challans numbered around 19,000+ in January alone.
5.3. Social media-driven ‚Äústunt driving‚Äù is emerging as a risk factor.

üìä Visualization Strategy
6. Visualization Methods
6.1. Heatmaps: Plot accident density using geocoded crash data.
6.2. Hotspot overlays: Visualize police/GIS-identified black spots.
6.3. Time-based plots: Show accident frequency by hour.
6.4. Conditional layers: Map rain/flood zones, underpasses.
6.5. Behavior overlays: Identify zones of high rule violations.
