Task 03: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

ðŸ§¾ Steps Overview

1. Collect Data
- Gather social media posts using APIs (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) or web scraping tools.
- Use relevant keywords and hashtags to filter posts related to your topic.
- Store collected data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or database).

2. Clean Text
- Remove emojis, links, HTML tags, and punctuation to reduce noise.
- Convert all text to lowercase for consistency.
- Tokenize text into individual words or tokens.
- Optionally, remove stopwords and perform stemming or lemmatization.

3. Analyze Sentiment
- Lexicon-based approach: Use tools like VADER or TextBlob to assign sentiment scores.
- Machine Learning-based approach: Train classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) on labeled data to predict sentiment.
- Optionally, use deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for more advanced analysis.

4. Classify Sentiment
- Label each post as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on sentiment scores or model predictions.
- For more detailed analysis, classify posts into specific emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness).

5. Visualize Results
- Line chart: Show sentiment trends over time.
- Bar chart or pie chart: Display overall sentiment distribution.
- Heatmap: Visualize sentiment intensity by region or time.
- Wordcloud: Highlight frequent terms for each sentiment class.
